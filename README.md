# project1-ajgcmwmw: What Happened On...?
Created by George Campa, Armando Jimenez, and Matthew Winemiller.

## Deployed website: https://mrrwmix.github.io/project1-ajgcmwmw/

## Description

This website uses jQuery, Sass, Google Material Design Lite, and various APIs to display information about an inputted date. 

## Design Process

We initially decided to base our API queries on searching for what happened on the user's birthday. Later on, we realized that you could really enter whichever date you'd like. Thus, we renamed the project to "What Happened On...?" The toughest part was finding APIs that worked well with searching for dates. We ended up with 3: The NY Times API, USGS API, and a NASA API. The Giphy API is also included, but it just generates random gifs associated with the previous 3 APIs. 
  
The new technologies we used were Material Design Lite and Sass. We were accustomed to using Bootstrap prior to this project, so Material Design Lite ended up feeling extremely limited. We had to manually edit a lot of CSS, so Sass helped with that. 
 
At first, we used the Live Share extension on VS Code to create an initial skeleton website. This is so we would know the function of each div that we needed to manipulate with code. After that, each group member was assigned an API. Everyone worked together on styling, and the majority of time was spent doing so.
